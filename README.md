# X-Encryption Algorithm

This is a repository for the data obtained during the performance tests for a novel encryption algorithm proposed in paper **"Portable device to collect vital signs with facial authentication and secure transmissions using chaos"**. It is divided as follows:

**BaboonData.xls** includes the raw data divided in the RGB components of the test image Baboon along with the data extracted from the cryptogram obtained after processing the image through the proposed algorithm. This data is shown in the histograms illustrated in Figure 4 and Table 2.

**BaboonCorrelation.xls** includes the raw data divided in the different tests applied to the algorith to test its performance and behaviour. This data is illstrated in Figures 5, 6, 7 and in Table 4.
